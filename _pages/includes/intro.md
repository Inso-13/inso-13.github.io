Currently, I am fortunate to be a visiting student at [MMLAB@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/), advised by Prof. [Ziwei Liu](https://liuziwei7.github.io/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2023.  My current research interest is 3D avatars, working on fast and high-quality 3D avatar creations.
